     <p>  As you can see every type of animal and invertebrate has a certain percentage that is endangered, with some species being very close to extinction, or could even become extinct as you are reading this. It’s not just animals that are in trouble, plants are struggling as well. Without some of these key species ecosystem are at risk of collapsing and if that happens there may not be a return from it. <br>
<br> <h4>How Conservation Helps</h4> Conservation strives to help keep these ecosystems alive in many ways. One way is to protect the ecosystem as a whole from any type of malicious human activity. Another way that’s common amongst animal conservationists is breeding and releasing these endangered animals back into their native habitats. But that costs a lot of time and money. Which is why a lot of places like those need funding either from private or public investors. <br>
<br> This website strives to bring conservational awareness to animals, but more specifically those of the avian family. </p>
